		<b>Welcome to Grad School!</b> </BR>
		Congratulations to being admitted for a PhD!
		Now all you have to do is finish it while not running out of your most valuable resources: food, reputation, and sanity. 
		</BR>
		</BR>
		<b>Game preparation:</b> </BR>
		You've opened this page. That's a good start. All your resources start at level 3.
		Cards are shuffled. Each player picks up 2 cards from the PhD card stack. The player who last started their PhD begins. </BR> 
		</BR>
		<b>Gameplay:</b></BR>
		Players take turns in clockwise. The active player picks up two more cards and loses 1 <font color="green"> food</font>.
		Each turn, the active player has three time slots (unless otherwise stated on a card). During this time, a player can choose to spend their time the following activities: a) play cards b) go to a seminar c) sit at their desk d) call in sick e) work on their research. The combined time value of these activities has to stay below or equal to the remaining time in that player's turn. How long an action takes can be found in the top right corner of the playing cards.</BR>
		</BR>
		<b>a) Playing cards:</b></BR>
		There are three kinds of cards: <font color='orange'>Regular cards</font>, <font color='DeepSkyBlue'>keepers</font>, <font color='FireBrick'>twist of fate cards</font>. </BR>
		<font color='orange'>Regular cards</font> can only be played during a players turn. That player gains or loses resources and time mentioned on the card. Some cards may include the possibility to roll a die in order to determine benefits and drawbacks. They may also become a keeper. </BR>
		<font color='DeepSkyBlue'>Keepers</font> can be played during a player's turn. From that time on, they stay infront of the player until the player decides to discard it (which can be done at any time). Effects will reocurr in every turn and are activated simultaneously. A keeper might also have a one-off effect.</BR>
		<font color='FireBrick'>Twist of fate cards</font> can be played on another player at any time of the game. Effects get resolved during that player's turn.</BR>
		</BR>
		<b>b)<font color='green'> Going to a seminar (recovering food):</b> </font> </BR>
		Attending a seminar costs 1 time and will <font color="green">recover 1 food</font> at the possible expense of <font color="purple"> reputation</font> or <font color="MediumVioletRed"> sanity</font>  determined by die roll. </BR>
		1-2 Last row seat, you can play on your phone - nothing happens. </BR>
		3-4 You fall asleep. <font color="purple">Lose 1 reputation. </font> </BR>	
		5-6 You get a front row seat. <font color="MediumVioletRed">Lose 1 sanity. </font> </BR>
		</BR>
		<b>c) <font color='purple'>Sitting at your desk (recovering reputation):</b> </font></BR>
		Sitting at your desk costs 2 time and will <font color="purple">recover 1 reputation</font> at the possible expense of <font color="green"> food</font> or <font color="MediumVioletRed"> sanity</font> determined by die roll. </BR>
		1-2 You eat all the food you stored at your desk for times like these. <font color="green">Lose 1 food</font>. </BR>
		3-4 You manage to concentrate and get something done. </BR>	
		5-6 You realise it's Sunday. <font color="MediumVioletRed">Lose 1 sanity. </font> </BR>
		</BR>
		<b>d) <font color="MediumVioletRed">Calling in sick (recovering sanity):</b></font></BR>
		Takind a sick-day costs 3 time and will <font color="MediumVioletRed">recover 1 sanity</font> at the possible expense of <font color="green"> food</font> or <font color="purple"> reputation</font> determined by die roll. </BR>
		1-2 You are so bored, you eat all day. <font color="green">Lose 1 food. </font> </BR>
		3-4 You looked fine yesterday, so people aren't so sure they believe you. <font color="purple">Lose 1 reputation. </font> </BR>	
		5-6 You have a lovely day at home. </BR>
		</BR>
		<b>e) Working on research (Getting reserach tokens):</b> </BR>
		In order to finish a PhD, a player must collect research tokens in the following order: Literature review, Experiment, Publish. These can be earned by working on their research during their turn at the cost of two time slots. If the research acivity is successful is determined by dice roll. The three different research areas are based on the three different resources and the die roll must be below the according resource. <font color="green"> Literature review is based on food</font>, <font color="purple"> experiments are based on reputation</font>, <font color="MediumVioletRed"> publishing is based on sanity</font>. The player must roll lower than the acording resource.</BR>
		</BR>
		<b>"I ran out of food/reputation/sanity/time...!":</b></BR>
		As soon as a player runs out of a resource, they must recover it before they can do anything else. If the player has no cards to do this, they must attend a seminar, do some work, or call in sick. If more than one resource is at 0, <font color="green"> food</font> is the first priority, then <font color="MediumVioletRed"> sanity</font>, then <font color="purple"> reputation</font>. If this results in negative other resource, that value stays 0. If a keeper card doesn't contribute to that resource, it must also be discarded.</BR>
		If a player runs out of time while having a keeper card (for example due to an unfortunate twist of fate), the keeper has to be discarded.</BR>
